# tinyMATH
A small math library implemented in my blog posts on Computer Graphics Math

## Usage
```python
from tinymath import Vector

# creating a vector
my_vector = Vector(x=1.2, y=2.3, z=3.4, w=5.6)

# creating a zero vector
zero_vector = Vector.zero()

# operations
add = my_vector + zero_vector
sub = my_vector - zero_vector
```
